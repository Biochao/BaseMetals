# Base Metals
## DrCyano's Base Metals Mod
This mod adds historically commonly used metals to Minecraft, specifically silver, copper, tin, lead, zinc, mercury, and nickel. You will also find a number of metal alloys in this mod and a new tool: the Rock Hammer.

Fantasy metals have been added to the Nether and the End: Mithril, Cold Iron, Adamantine, and Star Steel

## Metals and Alloys
*Natural Metals*
Copper: Copper is soft, easy to work, and fairly abundant
Silver: Silver is a soft, shiney metal that is valued for both is beauty and its alchemical uses
Tin: Tin is an extremely soft metal that is not useful by itself, but is commonly added to other metals to make strong alloys
Lead: Lead is a very soft metal that is best known for being very heavy and somewhat toxic
Zinc: Like tin, zinc is worthless on its own, but can be used to make metal alloys
Mercury: This toxic liquid metal has many alchemical uses
Nickel: This metal is as soft as copper, but it has alchemical properties and forms alloys with iron

*Metal Alloys*
Bronze: This alloy of tin and copper is as hard as iron, but not quite as durable
Brass: This alloy of copper and zonc is soft, but has a beautiful golden color.
Steel: This alloy of iron and carbon is as hard as iron and as durable as diamond
Invar: This alloy of iron and nickel is as hard as iron
Electrum: This alloy of silver and gold can be enchanted like gold, but is slightly more durable

*Fantasy Metals*
Cold Iron (found in the Nether): Strong as iron. Tools made from Cold Iron are extra effective against arthropods.
Adamantine (found in the Nether): Strong as diamond. Armor made from Adamantine grants resistance to damage and tools made from adamantine are extra effective against ghasts and blazes.
Mithril (alloy of cold iron and silver): Strong as steel. Mithral weapons are extra effective against undead.
Star Steel (found in the End): Armor made from Star Steel grants the wearer the ability to jump higher and fall slower. Star Steel tools slowly repair themselves while held.

## Q&A
Q: Why make this mod?
A: Minecraft appears to have a pre-industrial fantasy setting, but the fantasy literature (and pre-industrial history) is full of references to silver and copper as well as gold.

Q: What does the Rock Hammer do?
A: When you break ores with the Rock Hammer, you get two piles of metal powders instead of a single block of ore. This is necessary to make metal alloys, which is done by combining the powders of the verious components and then smelting the alloy mix.
